<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! </p>

<p>
  My name is Pedro Teixeira, i'm from Portugal and i'm an electrical engineer 
  working, currently, as Projects and Orders Management Team Leader.
</p>
<p>In the last couple of years, i started to be curious about the IT sector. This curiosity led me, at a first stage,
  to explore the Agile framework which most of the IT Teams work on and therefore studied to be a Certified Product Owner (PSPO),
  which i finished on December 2023.
</p>
<p>Since I enjoyed this first contact with the IT sector, i decided to take a deeper dive and give a secound chance on programming 
  (in the university i had 2 courses on C and C++), and that was when i discovered the course The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr Angela Yu.
</p>
<p>This course has been a breath of fresh air that made me believe that joining my strong will and 
  my skills earned during my work path can led me to a new happy and fulfilled stage of life in this
sector. </p>
<p>I'm keen to learn more and looking forward to take my chances proving my worth as a Product Owner.</p>
